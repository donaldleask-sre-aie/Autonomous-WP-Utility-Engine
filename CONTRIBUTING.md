🤝 CONTRIBUTING.md
This project, Autonomous-WP-Utility-Engine, is an open-source initiative by Donald Leask (donaldleask-sre-aie) to showcase advanced AI-driven utility for WordPress. We welcome contributions from experienced developers who align with the philosophy of autonomous systems and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

Before submitting a Pull Request (PR), you must read the warnings in README.md and understand that all code is used at your own risk.

1. Code Standards and Quality
All submitted code must adhere to the following standards. PRs that do not meet these requirements will be closed without merge.

WordPress Coding Standards: All PHP, CSS, and JavaScript must strictly follow the official WordPress Coding Standards.

Clarity and Documentation: All functions and classes must be fully documented using PHPDoc format, explaining the logic, inputs, and outputs.

Scope: Contributions should maintain the utility and autonomous nature of the agent. New features must integrate cleanly with the existing tool registry framework.

2. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Issue First (Preferred): For major features or complex bug fixes, please open a detailed GitHub Issue first to discuss the implementation approach.

Branch Naming: Work on a feature branch named clearly (e.g., feature/add-image-compression or fix/db-transient-logic). Do not commit directly to main.

One Feature Per PR: Each Pull Request should address only one bug or one feature to simplify review.

Testing: Submissions should be locally tested on a development environment (not a live site) and proven not to introduce new errors.

3. Reporting Bugs and Security
Bugs: Report all confirmed bugs via the GitHub Issues tab. Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue.

Security: DO NOT POST VULNERABILITIES PUBLICLY. Refer to the SECURITY.md file for confidential disclosure instructions.

4. Zero Support Policy
This is a critical reminder:

The Issues tab is for Code Contributions, Bug Reports, and Feature Ideas ONLY.

DO NOT use Issues to ask for installation help, API key setup instructions, or basic configuration guidance. Such issues will be immediately closed without comment.

The author provides no personal support or troubleshooting.
